# CS 245 (Fall, 2018) PracticeAssignment03

The code that is in Practice03Test.java is correct and works. However, I was not able to make the program run from terminal.
I always got the message:

* Error: Could not find or load main class Practice03Test
* Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Practice03Test

However, I was able to manually change the size of the array through the intellij interface: Run > Edit Configurations
(Change program arguments to the desired length)

The only alterations I made to the Practice03Test.java file was the 3 methods I added:
    -find_min_iterative(arr)
    -find_min_recursive(arr)
    -helper(arr, first, min)
